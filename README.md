# ![Email Dogs](http://localhost:9000/images/dog-logo.png) email-optimized-dogs
A tool for creating dogs (and other pixel artworks) that are optimized for email.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/CopilotHQ/email-optimized-dogs.git`
2. Install NPM packages `npm install`
3. Install Bower libraries `bower install`
 
## Developing Locally
This repo is built using the [yeoman webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp), so it's pretty darn easy to spin up your development environment. All you have to do is run `gulp serve`.

## Building
Run `gulp build`.

I haven't set up the gulpfile well yet, so any new folders you add will need to be manually transferred from app to dist after you build.

@TODO - Fix above issue.
